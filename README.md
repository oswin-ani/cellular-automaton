# cellular-automaton-forest-fire
Forest fire propagation model using cellular automata.
I modeled a certain area of land, which is a checkered field, occupied by a certain percentage of forest. The user will be able to click on the mouse to identify the cell that is the source of the fire and monitor the spread of the fire (main.py).
You can also observe the spread of a fire in a forest with the presence of a river (main_river.py), a wind of a certain direction (main_wind.py), or both of these factors at the same time (main_wind_and_river.py).
